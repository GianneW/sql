**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous work and considering the insights from the lecture on data ethics, it is crucial to incorporate a more comprehensive approach to ethics and equity in data management and analysis. 
1. Ethics
On Thursday's lecture, Thomas talked about we need to consider: privacy and privacy policies, security and appropriate access to data, how database design affects our perception, labour rights for data entry, and bias in data entry.

Privacy is a fundamental right, and protecting personal data is both a legal and moral obligation. In our database work, particularly with SQL databases, we must ensure that sensitive information, such as customer names, purchase history is safeguarded against unauthorized access. Also, we need to implement privacy policies that align with regulations like HIPAA (PHIPA in Canada) to ensure data is not misused or disclosed without consent. 
For example, we could implement encryption for sensitive data and ensure access controls are strictly enforced, regularly audit access logs to ensure compliance with privacy policies and detect any unauthorized access.

We should recognize the human labor involved in data entry and management is critical. Often, the contributions of data entry personnel are invisible, yet their work forms the foundation of SQL databases. 

Moreover, it is essential to implement systems that can identify and correct biases, e.g. our database need to be designed with an awareness of potential biases and aim to create structures that are inclusive and representative of diverse populations.

2. Inequity
On the lecture, we knew that databases often become more useful if they are normalized.
We could consider further normalization of tables to avoid complex data structures that can obscure important details.

During the data collection steps, we need to ensure the methods are inclusive and representative, capturing diverse perspectives and avoiding the marginalization of any group. We should regularly review and update database schemas to reflect evolving norms and avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes.
During the analysis steps, for example, when analyzing customer purchases, it's important to be aware of any demographic information that might reveal disparities in purchasing power or access to products. If certain groups are underrepresented in the data, it could indicate broader systemic issues that need to be addressed. 

To conclude, including ethics and equity in managing and analyzing data is crucial.
